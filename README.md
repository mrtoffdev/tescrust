## Tescrust
A terminal-centric tabulator & data processing engine with a customizable responsive TUI & hotkey bindings, batteries included. Second to-be-released version of the Tescore series. Written in Rust and will support windows & linux-based systems

---
### ðŸ“¢ Warning: This is a work in progress, and is by no means a functional tool yet. Currently working on developing a TUI library using crossterm alongside this project, which is what's mostly occupying development time, and will most likely receive its own repository in the future ðŸ“¢
